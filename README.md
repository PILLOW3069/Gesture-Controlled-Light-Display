# LEDs-with-Hand-Gesture-Control
This mini-project employs computer vision and Python to calculate the distance between two fingers and then illuminate LEDs accordingly. The number of LEDs that illuminate is proportional to the distance between the fingers.

*How to Run :

- connect Arduino with the System 
- Run the Program.ino in the Arduino IDE
- run Runner.py
- Make sure both the programs have the same BAUD rate
